I recieved help from a tutor for PyBank and she helped me debug my code and format correctly. I also recieved assistance from another TA for PyPoll and they helped me place the print(candidate_results) in the correct place since I was not getting the results of each candidate, I was only getting the result of the last candidate. I did use code from stackoverflow to get the formatting of line 79 in PyPoll, (.3f}%). I also used stackoverflow and google to figure out how to code the output results to a text file.
